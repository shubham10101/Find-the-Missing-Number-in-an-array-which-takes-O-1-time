//let's understand this 

// ((n +1)* (n+2)/2) - (((n)* (n+1)/2)+1

//(n)* (n+1)/2 =  sum of natural numbers 

// ((n +1)* (n+1+1)/2) = sum of natural numbers  here 1 is added with n because of in number's there is one number is missing so we add 1

//let's take  

//sum of natural no. where one no. is missing as  A = (n +1)* (n+1+1)/2     and    

//sum of existing no. in array  as  B= (n)* (n+1)/2  

// now when we perform Sum of existing no. in array it always give us 1 value less than the expected ans    

//so we will add 1 no. with this

// let's understand this with an example    B={1,2,3,4,5,7}  here   n =6   (elements in a)  

// n*(n+1)/2  

//  =  6 * 7 / 2

//  =  21  

//  but expected ans is 22 (is sum of no. in B ) so that's why we have to add 1  with B

//now   T=   A    -  (B+1)

//   or T =    ( ( n  + 1 ) *  ( n + 2 ) / 2)     -   ( ( ( n ) *   ( n + 1 ) / 2 ) + 1);


input: arr[] = {1, 3, 2 , 4 , 5 ,7 }
output: 6
Explanation: The missing number from 1 to 7 is 6
